# Repo contents

### 2020_2024_bat_sampling - Sheet1.csv

This is the data that is used throughout the project. It contains much
information relating to the bats that were captured by the Enard lab from
2020 to 2024, inclusive. Of particular interest are the species ANPA
(Antrozous pallidus, the pallid bat) and PAHE (Parastrellus hesperus, the
canyon bat) for the scope of this investigation.

### pallids-and-canyons.Rproj

This is the R project file that is used to contain all the files within
this repo.

### README.md

Ah! You've found me!

### the_main_script.R

This is the R script that contains every analysis I carried out. It is
fairly heavily annotated, so I will let those annotations speak for
themselves in guiding you through the process of generating the same
figures I did, if you would like. Speaking of figures...

### activity_by_female_reproductive_status.png

This is a figure that collects several related graphs, all about the
times of activity of the two focal species (ANPA and PAHE) split across
female reproductive status.

### labeled_activity_times.png

This is a graph that shows the times of activity of both species,
overlaid onto each other. Additionally, there are some values from
the different statistical analyses I carried out included on the graph.
